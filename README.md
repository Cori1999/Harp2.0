This project is for the proof of concept for the senior capstone. 
The current apps targeted for kids was designed to genetate profit, but more and more children are being exposed to innaporopriate content due to the process it uses. By allowing users to upload videos, some people include graphic content. Even after such content is reported, there has been countless instances where videos were not taken down quickly enough, and even more children were exposed. 
My goal is to create a non-profit site designed to be benefical to children. I beleive that parents will continue to allow their children to have access to technology-- beginning earlier & earlier. I do not think the solution is to say that this is wrong and leave YouTube kids as the only option. Instead, there should be an option designed for childrens developing impressionable minds. 
This is where Harp comes in!
Harp is short for Harper, who this whole project is currated for. I want to build a safer virtual enviornemtn for children, startign with my own little sister! I would not have realized the gravirty of the issue, or had to passion to work towards a better solution if it wasn't for her!
